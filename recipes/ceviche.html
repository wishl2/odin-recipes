    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Ceviche is a popular Latin American dish made by macerating raw fish and
      seafood in an acidic liquid like citrus juice along with ingredients such
      as chiles, onions, and herbs. The acid in the marinade denatures the
      proteins in the fish, causing it to become opaque and producing a firm,
      flaky texture, similar to when it's cooked with heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word ceviche (pronounced "seh-VEE-chay") refers both to the food
      itself as well as the method for preparing it. Different countries in
      South and Central America have different spellings for the word, with
      seviche or cebiche being some of the most common variants. And each
      country puts its unique spin on the dish, whether by using different fish
      or seafood or by what sorts of ingredients are used to prepare the
      marinade.
