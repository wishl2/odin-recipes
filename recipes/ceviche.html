        <p class="description">
            <strong>Ceviche </strong>is a popular Latin American dish made by
            macerating raw fish and seafood in an acidic liquid like citrus
            juice along with ingredients such as chiles, onions, and herbs. The
            acid in the marinade denatures the proteins in the fish, causing it
            to become opaque and producing a firm, flaky texture, similar to
            when it's cooked with heat.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            The word <strong>ceviche </strong>(<em>pronounced</em>
            "seh-VEE-chay") refers both to the food itself as well as the method
            for preparing it. Different countries in South and Central America
            have different spellings for the word, with <em>seviche</em> or
            <em>cebiche</em>being some of the most common variants. And each
            country puts its unique spin on the dish, whether by using different
            fish or seafood or by what sorts of ingredients are used to prepare
            the marinade.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <em>Prepare the seafood:</em> Clean and cut the octopus and
                    scallops into bite-sized pieces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a bowl, combine the seafood with freshly squeezed citrus
                    juice (like lime or lemon) and let it marinate for about
                    15-20 minutes, until the seafood is opaque.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the seafood is marinating, dice the avocado, cucumber,
                    and pineapple into small pieces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once the seafood is ready, drain some of the marinade if
                    desired, then gently fold in the diced avocado, cucumber,
                    pineapple, and any additional ingredients like wasabi.
