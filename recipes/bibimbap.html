    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It's called bibimbap (pronounced "bee-BIM-bop")—bibim meaning "mixed" and
      bap meaning "rice." This beloved Korean bowl incorporates steamed white
      rice with assorted fresh, marinated, and sautéed vegetables along with raw
      or seared meat, if desired.
    </p>

      When you see the most gorgeous finished product, you might think bibimbap
      is too complicated for you, but you'd be wrong. It's been around for
      centuries and ancient lore has it straddling the highest and lowest
      echelons of society: Some say it was served to emperors and government
      officials at lavish parties, while others say that it was a cheap and
      convenient one-bowl meal that farmers' wives made using seasonal
      ingredients mixed with rice. Either way, these legends still ring true as
      bibimbap can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be.
