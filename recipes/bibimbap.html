    <h2>üåü Description</h2>
    <p>
      It's called <strong>bibimbap </strong> (<em>pronounced</em> "bee-BIM-bop")‚Äî<em>bibim</em> meaning "mixed" and
      <em>bap</em> meaning "rice." This beloved Korean bowl incorporates steamed white
      rice with assorted fresh, marinated, and saut√©ed vegetables along with raw
      or seared meat, if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you see the most gorgeous finished product, you might think <strong>bibimbap</strong>
      is too complicated for you, but you'd be wrong. It's been around for
      centuries and ancient lore has it straddling the highest and lowest
      echelons of society: Some say it was served to emperors and government
      officials at lavish parties, while others say that it was a cheap and
      convenient one-bowl meal that farmers' wives made using seasonal
      ingredients mixed with rice. Either way, these legends still ring true as
      <strong>bibimbap</strong> can be as complicated or as simple as you want it to be.
